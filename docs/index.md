# SEVA Developer Documentation

Welcome to the SEVA documentation.

This documentation is intended for developers working on the SEVA GUI
(MVVM architecture) and the associated REST API.

## Start here

If you are new to the project, follow this order:

1. Read the **Architecture Overview**
2. Explore the **SEVA GUI workflows**
3. Dive into class and module documentation as needed

## Scope

This documentation focuses on:

- application architecture
- workflows and control flow
- responsibilities of major modules

It does **not** document UI usage for end users.
